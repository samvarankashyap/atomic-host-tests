#   This role verifies the atomic stop command.  It takes one parameter which
#   is the container name and will check that the status is exited. This role
#   requires atomic_run_verify to be run before and that there are no other
#   containers running prior to that.
#
#   Commands:
#   - atomic stop
#
- name: Fail if container is undefined
  fail:
    msg="No container specified"
  when: container is undefined

- name: atomic stop {{ container }}
  command: atomic stop {{ container }}

- name: Verify container is stopped
  command: docker ps -a
  register: dps

- name: Fail if {{ container }} status is not exited
  fail:
    msg="Container is not Up or Created in docker ps -a output"
  when: dps.stdout.find("Exited") == -1
