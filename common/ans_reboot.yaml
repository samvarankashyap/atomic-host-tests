# vim: set ft=ansible:
# There is no clean way to restart hosts in ansible. The general issue is that
# the shutdown command may close sshd before ansible has time to "return" from
# the task, even with async & poll. This is due to the fact that asynchronous
# tasks still require a small synchronous bootstrapping script which takes 1 sec
# to complete, during which it is vulnerable to erroring out if sshd dies.
#       To mitigate this, we prefix a sleep command before the shutdown so
# ansible has time to move on. For more info on this issue, see:
# https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/10616

- name: restart hosts
  shell: sleep 3 && shutdown -r now
  async: 1
  poll: 0
  ignore_errors: true

# NB: The following tasks use local actions, so we need to explicitly ensure
# that they don't use sudo, which may require a password, and is not necessary
# anyway.

- name: wait for hosts to come down
  local_action: wait_for host={{ inventory_hostname }} port=22 state=stopped
  sudo: false

- name: wait for hosts to come back up
  local_action: wait_for host={{ inventory_hostname }} port=22 state=started
  sudo: false
