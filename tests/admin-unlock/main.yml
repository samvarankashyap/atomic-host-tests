#
# Core Functionality
#   Verify rpms can installed and uninstalled after ostree admin unlock
#   Verify overlayfs is created after running ostree admin unlock
#     (use mount command verify presence of overlayfs mount)
#   Verify ostree admin status indicates "Unlocked: development" after running
#     ostree admin unlock
#   Verify that changes to deployment after ostree admin unlock do not persist
#     through reboot.
#   Verify overlayfs is removed (use mount command verify absence of overlayfs
#       mount)
#   Verify ostree admin status does not show locked deployment
#   Verify rpms can be installed and uninstalled after ostree admin unlock
#     --hotfix and changes persist through reboot.
#   Verify ostree admin status indicates "Unlocked: hotfix"
#   Verify a clone of the current deployment is added to the deployment
#   Use rpm-ostree status to verify there are two deployments with the same
#     commit ID
#   Verify overlayfs is created (use mount command verify presence of overlayfs
#      mount)
#   Verify rpms can still be installed and uninstalled after reboot
#   Verify ostree admin unlock --hotfix overwrites any other deployment already
#      on the system
#   Verify rollback between hotfixed deployment and regular deployment
# NOT TESTED:
#   Verify upgrade from hotfixed deployment
#     Upgrade should be successful
#     Packages installed in previous unlocked deployment should not be present
#       in the upgraded deployment
#
# Negative Testing
#   Verify rpms cannot be installed without ostree admin unlock
#   Run ostree admin unlock twice.  Verify that an error message specifying
#     that the deployment is already in an unlocked state: development
#   Run ostree admin unlock, then ostree admin unlock --hotfix.  Verify that
#     an error message specifying that the deployment is already in an unlocked
#     state: development
#   Run ostree admin unlock --hotfix twice.  Verify that an error message
#     specifying that the deployment is already in an unlocked state: hotfix
#   Run ostree admin unlock --hotfix then ostree admin unlock.  Verify that an
#     error message specifying that the deployment is already in an unlocked
#     state: hotfix
