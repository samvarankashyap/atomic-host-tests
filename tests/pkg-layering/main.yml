# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# !!!NOTE!!! This playbook was tested using Ansible 2.1; it is recommended
# that the same version is used.
#
# This playbook is actually multiple playbooks contained in a single file.
# I had to take this approach, because I encountered difficulties re-using
# the same roles with non-unique variables.  Sometimes the roles would be
# executed with the use of the 'always' tag, sometimes not.
#
# The wrinkle in this approach is that sharing global variables across the
# multiple playbooks requires the use of a file containing the variables
# which is included in each playbook with the 'vars_files' directive.
#
# Core Functionality
#   - Verify rpms package can be layered through rpm-ostree install
#   - Verify multiple rpm packages can be layered through rpm-ostree install
#   - Verify rpm packages can be removed through rpm-ostree uninstall
#   - Verify multiple rpm packages can be removed through rpm-ostree uninstall
#   - Verify rpm-ostree status output displays "Package: <pkg1> <pkg2>.." when packages are layered
#   - Verify the -r / --reboot flag reboots the host after rpm-ostree install or rpm-ostree uninstall
#   - Verify the -n / --dry-run flag does not perform the package add/remove function and displays a summary of packages to be installed
#   - Verify a dry-run of rpm-ostree install|uninstall does not affect an existing package that has been layered, but not rebooted.
#   - Verify that after additional repos are enabled (i.e. EPEL), rpm-ostree install|uninstall can be successfully used for packages in those repos.
#
# Negative Testing
#   - Verify correct error is displayed removing a package that does not exist
#   - Verify correct error is displayed when adding a package that does not exists in the repo
#   - Verify correct error message is displayed when adding a package that is already in the deployment
#   - Verify packages which have files with non-root ownership cannot be installed
#   - Verify that install/uninstall operations cannot be performed by unprivileged users
